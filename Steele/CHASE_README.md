Hey Chase, 

Year: 1933, Make: Stutz Model: Stutz, BUT in our golden master there are 3 different models

On the steele Rubber site they do not have 3 different models they only have the model Stutz 
https://www.steelerubber.com/search?year=1933&make=stutz&model=stutz&style=0-door-u-k&s=pricedesc&ps=50

For us I think it means to choose all the 1933 Stutz models but just wanted to verify with you that’s the functionality you wanted. If it helps I can add another row 

So instead of this 

:robot_face: Processing: 1933 Stutz Stutz
   Step 1 - Confirmed: 1933 Stutz
   Step 2 - Found 3 real models in golden master
           Models: Model DV-32, Model LAA, Model SV-16
   Step 3 - Selected: Model DV-32
   :white_check_mark: Final: 1933_Stutz_Model_DV-32


We will do this

:robot_face: Processing: 1933 Stutz Stutz
   Step 1 - Confirmed: 1933 Stutz
   Step 2 - Found 3 real models in golden master
           Models: Model DV-32, Model LAA, Model SV-16
   Step 3 - Selected: Model DV-32
   :white_check_mark: Final: 1933_Stutz_Model_DV-32, 1933_Stutz_Model LAA, 1933_Stutz_Model SV-16

Here’s the full infor from my sample csv if that helps.
