I'm building descriptions for my ecommerce website for vintage auto parts for dodge, Chrysler, Desoto and Plymouth cars. I'll provide you a title of the part, the vehicle it fits, the category of part it is and any engine data (if applicable). I'd like you write me a full product description, a meta title and a meta description (limited to 160 characters) for each product . I'd like you to use the voice of a trusted neighborly mechanic that isn't trying to sell the product, but rather just explain it's usefulness in an informative way
